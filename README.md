## 1. Scenario explanation

I will be creating the linear regression model by using linear algebra and statistics, and then verify my findings using the linear regression functions in R.

## 2. Obtaining and cleaning the data

* **Description of data source**

For this analysis, I will be using data supplied by the Kaggle user [Miri Choi](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218) called _Medical Cost Personal Datasets_. This dataset can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/), or in my [repository]().

This data was obtained in 2018, but as I am aiming to test out my LRM creation skills, the data does not have to be timely.

The data is considered [open data](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1-0/).
